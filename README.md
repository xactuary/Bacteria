Study of Bacteria in Belly Button Lint
## Summary
This web app lets you choose a sample number from the drop down list and display a bubble chart of the presence of different types of bacteria found in the belly button lint sample for that individual.  This can be compared against the bar chart below that shows the top frequency of bacteria values and the gauge which shows how many times a week that sample owner washes their belly button.
### Challenge items
I added an image to the Jumbotron, I changed the format by moving the bubble chart up to the top which makes it easier to see when the sample value is changed and I changed a lot of the background colors to make the page more interesting.
